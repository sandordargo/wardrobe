Tables by category
view by category, simple, key matter as ordered by key
view by size/sex
    loop all cat
    difficult, as it will go by category then sex
        should throw away other sex results and basically loop over 3 times


Tables by category/sex
view by category is difficult because we ahve to list 3 different tables, cat_boy, cat_girl, cat_uni
as we cannot mix them, we won't be able to have the same sizes next to each other
view by size, then sex is... simple, just have to throw away all the non size results


1) find a way to mix the listenables
2) maintain tables in both ways
3) use another db -> use sqlie
